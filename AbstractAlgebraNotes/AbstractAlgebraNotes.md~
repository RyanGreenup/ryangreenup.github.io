## Numbers and Sets

This is mostly reproduced in the Topic 1 section on Sets in the [Analysis Notes](https://ryangreenup.github.io/AnalysisNotes/AnalysisNotes.html#an(1)sets)

### Set Orders

The Natural Numbers have an intuitive order:

$0<1<2<3<4 \dots$

As to the Real Numbers:

$-99<-1<0<e<\pi<e^{4\pi}<\frac{999}{2}​$

However, the [Field of Complex Numbers](#aa(5)rings2) has no intuitive order because the numbers do not exist on a line but on a plane.

On a line mathematical operations can be seen as a symmetrical transformation of that line, but on a plane order becomes somewhat arbitrary. [*3Blue1Brown](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvmuCPvRoWQ>) has a great video on this.

### Mathematical Induction

Refer to [these notes](https://ryangreenup.github.io/AnalysisNotes/AnalysisNotes.html#an(1)wop) in Analysis, they overlap entirely.

## Arithmetic and Divisibility

<a name="aa(1)divis"></a>

Whats important here, is the division Algorithm, which states:

> If an integer is divided by some $b \in \mathbb{N} $ , there will always be some remainder  $r \enspace : \enspace 0<r<b$

This is a pretty straightforward proposition, but it underlies all later proofs of abstract algebra.

### Properties of the Integers

Investigating the properties of number sets will be important later for considering the algebraic structure of sets, but for now, consider the 6 properties of the integers:

1. **Associative** under addition and multiplication
   1. $\forall (a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z}), a + (b+c) = (a+b) + c$
   2. $\forall (a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z}), a \cdot (b\cdot c) = (a\cdot b) + c$
2. **Commutative** under multiplication and addition
   1. $\forall (a,b \in \mathbb{Z}),  a + b = b + a$
   2. $\forall (a,b \in \mathbb{Z}),  a \cdot b = b \cdot a$
3. There always exists a unique **additive Identity**, $0$
   1. $\forall x \in \mathbb{z}, !\exists 0 : 0+x=x​$
4. There always exists a unique **multiplicative identity**, $1$
   1. $\forall x \in \mathbb{z}, !\exists 1 : 1\cdot x=x$
5. Every integer has an **additive inverse**\
   1. $\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}, \exists (-x) : x + (-x) = 0$
6. Addition and multiplication satisfy the **distributive law**
   1. $\forall (x,y,z \in \mathbb{Z}), (x\cdot y) + (x\cdot z)$

### Divisibility Definition

Let $a$ and $b$ be integers with $b \neq 0$:
$$
(a,b) \in \mathbb{Z} : b \neq 0
$$
it is said that $b$ **divides** $a$ (written $b|a$), if there is some integer $q$ such that $\enspace a = b\cdot q$:
$$
b|a \iff \exists q \in \mathbb{Z} : a = b\cdot q
$$
This is the same as saying:

* $a$ is **divisible** by $b$
* $a$ is a **multiple** of $b$

### Divisibility Properties

1. $a|b \enspace  \wedge \enspace b|c \implies a|c$
2. $a|b \enspace \wedge \enspace a|c \implies a|(mb + nc)$

#### 
##### Proof
Observe that:
$a|b \implies b = k\cdot a, \enspace \exists t \in \mathbb{Z} \quad \text{and} \quad b|c \implies c = s \cdot b, \enspace \exists s \in \mathbb{z}$

### Division Algorithm

The definition of the algorithm:

Let $a$ and $b$ bey any integers with $b >0$.

There are unique integers $q$ and $r$ such that $a = qb +r$, where $0 \leq r <b$, i.e.:
$$
!\exists (q,r \in \mathbb{Z}, \enspace q \neq r)  : (a = qb +r) \wedge (0 \leq r < b)
$$

## Greatest Common Divisors and Euclids Algorithm

### Definition of the GCD

Suppose $a$ and $b$ are nonzero integers, the *greatest common divisor* of $a$ and $b$ is the largest integer that divides both of them and is denoted:

​                   $gcd(a,b)​$

Observe some properties of the gcd

1. $\gcd(0,0)$ is undefined because it would be    

2. $\gcd(a,0) = a$ ; because any number divides     and the largest number that divides     is itself
   1. unless $a=0​$ in which case it would be like (1) above.

3. $\gcd(b, qb) = b​$ ; because the $b​$ divides both terms and is the largest possible divisor of$b​$

### Theorem 1

The $\gcd(a,b)$ is the smallest positive integer that can be expressed in the form:
$$
ma + nb : (m,n \in \mathbb{Z})
$$

#### Corollary

Observe further, that for $x \in \mathbb{Z}$ , thwse two statements are wholly equivalent:

1. $x = ma+nb$
2. $\gcd(a,b)|x

> i.e. $x = ma + nb \iff \gcd(a,b) | x$



### Relatively Prime

#### Definition

Suppose $a$ and $b$ are non-zero integers, they are *relatively prime* (i.e. *coprime*) if $\gcd(a,b)=1​$

#### Proposition; Relatively Prime by GCD

Suppose $a$ and $b$ are non-zero integers, and let $\gcd(a,b) =d$

Then $\frac{a}{d}$ and $\frac{b}{d}$ are relatively prime.

### Euclid's Lemma (P.18)

#### Definition

Suppose $a, b, c$ are integers such that $a$ and $b$ are coprime.

if $b\cdot c$ is a multiple of $a$,

Then $c$ must be a multiple of $a$

​	(because $p$ was prime)

### Theorem; GCD becomes Remainder and Factor

Suppose $(a,b,q,r)$ are all integers, such tat:
$$
a = qb +r
$$
Then, 
$$
\gcd(a,b) =\gcd(b,r)
$$

### Euclid's Algorithm (i.e. Calculating GCD's)

*Euclid's Algorithm* allows for a method to find the *Greatest Common Denominator*:

For two positive natural numbers, $a,b$ such that $a>b$:

1. write in the form of $a=qb+r$,  where $(q,r\in \mathbb{Z})$ with $0<r<b$
2. If $r=0$, then $a=q\cdot b$ and hence $\gcd(a,b) = \gcd(b,r)$
3. if $r\neq​$ 0, then $\gcd(a,b) = \gcd(b,r)​$
   1. Now repeat from step 1 

### Lowest Common Multiples

For two integers $(a,b) \in \mathbb{Z}$, the *Lowest Common Multiple*, is the smallest integer that is a multiple of both $a$ and $b$

The $LCM$ is a number that is the smallest possible multiple of other numbers

#### Finding the *LCM*

In order to find the *LCM* use the formula:
$$
\text{lcm} (a,b) = \frac{a\cdot b}{\gcd(a,b)}
$$

# (2) Prime Numbers
<a name="aatop3"></a>

[Back to Top](#antoc)

## Definitions

Prime and composite numbers are any numbers that satisfy the following conditions:

| Prime Numbers                                                | Composite Numbers                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| $$ 1. \enspace p>1 \\ 2. \enspace p \in \mathbb{z} \\ 3. \enspace  x|p \iff (x =1 \enspace \wedge \enspace x=p)$$ | $$1. \enspace c > 1 \\ 2. \enspace c \text{ is not prime}$$ |

Observe that $1$ is neither a prime nor a composite number, this is important for later

## Infinite Primes

### Summary

There are infinite prime numbers

### Proof

Suppose;

$$
S = \{p_1, p_2, p_3, \dots p_n\}
$$

is the set of the first $n$ prime numbers,

let:
$$
q = (p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot p_3 \cdot \dots p_n)
$$




Observe that $q$ would not be a multiple of any value $p \in S$ 

> <sub>Although this does not mean $q$ is necessarily prime (primes can be [much more difficult](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlpYjrbujG0) to generate), $q$ is possible a composite of primes not in $S$, but regardless, $q$ is not divisible by any $p \in S$ </sub>

Thus $S$ cannot contain all prime values.

Observe likewise, no set $S​$ could be constructed such that it contained all the primes

> <sub> or atleast no finite set $S​$ </sub>

$\therefore​$ , the set of all Prime numbers must not be finite (i.e. there are infinite primes). 

<div style="text-align: right">⬛ </div>

## Primes of Multiples

If a prime number divides a composite, it must divide one of
the factors of that composite number

### Summary

$p$ is a prime number *if and only if*:
$$
\forall (a,b \in \mathbb{z}), \enspace p|a\cdot b \implies p|a \enspace \vee \enspace p|b
$$

### Proof

Suppose $p​$ is a prime number:

$$
\enspace p | (a \cdot b)
$$

Either $p$ divides $a$ or it does not:

| $p\mid a$                                                    | $p\nmid a$                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| $p\mid a$ , thus<br />$$p\mid ab \implies p|a \vee p|b \quad \blacksquare$$ | $p \nmid a$, thus:<br /><br />$$gcd(a,p) = 1$$ <br /><br /> because $p|ab$ and $\gcd(a,p) = 1$<br /><br />Then by Euclid's Lemma:<br />$p|b$<br /><br />thus, <br />$p|ab \implies p|a \vee p|b \quad \blacksquare$ |

Thus:
$$
p|ab \implies p|a \vee p|b
$$

## Prime Factors

### Summary

Suppose $p$ is prime and $p$ divides some number $a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdot a_3 \dots a_n$

Then $p$ divides $a_k \enspace : \enspace 1 \leq k \leq n$

Moreover, if $a_k$ is prime, then $p=a_k$

## The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

### Summary

For any integer $n$:

1. $\enspace n = p^{k_1}_1\cdot p^{k_2}_2 \cdot p^{k_3}_3 \dots p^{k_m}_m$
2. The above factorisation of $n$ is unique to the value of $n$

This proof is provided on p. 28 of the TB.

### Corollary, Rational Numbers

Every rational number can be expressed in a lowes form of relatively prime integers.

#### Summary

Every rational number can be expressed uniquely as some fraction of integers:
$$
\forall r \in \mathbb{Q}, \enspace !\exists m,n \in \mathbb{Z} : r = \frac{m}{n}
$$

##### $\sqrt{2}$ is not rational

A rational number can be expressed as a ratio, $\sqrt{2}$ cannot be, the proof is in the [Analysis Textbook](http://booksdl.org/get.php?md5=ef3626243a81006414e1f5a67ce694e0) at [2.1.4].

###### Proof

Just refer to the textbook

## Theorems of Euler and Fermat (ch. [1.7])

<a name="aa(2)euler"></a>

### Euler-Phi Function

The *Euler-Phi Function* counts the number of integers relatively prime to $n$ that are less than $n$,

#### Definition

for $n \geq 1$;

$\phi(n)$ is the number of positive integers less than or equal to $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$

> e.g. $2, 3, 7$ are relatively prime to $10$, thus $\phi(10) = 3$

### Powers of Euler-Phi Function

#### Summary

if $p$ is prime and $i \geq 1$,
$$
\begin{align}
\phi(p^i) &= p^i - p^{i-1} \\
&=p^i(1-frac{1}{p})
\end{align}
$$

#### Proof

All the numbers between $1$ and $p-1$ are relatively prime to p, thus $\phi(p)=p-1$.

All integers less than $p^i$ (for $i\geq 1$) are relatively prime to $p^i$ except for multiples of $p$.
	i.e. all values less than $p^i$ are relatively prime except for $1p,2p,3p \dots p^(i-1) p$.

So there are exactly $p^{i-1}$ multiples of $p$ that are multiples and hence not relatively prime.

Thus there is a total of $p^i-p^{i-1}$ numbers between $1$ and $p^i$ that are relatively prime to $p^i$.

### Euler-Phi Function is Multiplicative

#### Summary

For positive relatively prime integers $m$ and $n$:
$$
\gcd(m, n) = 1 \implies \phi(m \cdot n) = \phi(m) \cdot \phi(n)
$$

#### Proof

Refer to p. 44 of the TB.

#### Corollary

for primes $p, e \in \mathbb{N}$,

Given some $n$ value:
$$
n = p^{e_1}_1 \times p^{e_2}_2 \times p^{e_3}_3 \times p^{e_r}_r
$$

Then the Euler Phi function is:

$$
\phi(n) = p^{e_1-1}_1 \cdot (p_1-1) \times p^{e_2-1}_2 \cdot (p_2-1) \times p^{e_3-1}_3 \cdot (p_3-1) \dots p^{e_r-1}_r \cdot (p_r-1)
$$

Further it follows:

$$
\phi(n) = n \times \frac{p_1 -1}{p_1} \times \frac{p_2 -1}{p_2} \times \frac{p_3 -1}{p_3} \times \frac{p_r -1}{p_r}
$$

### Eulers Theorem

<a name="aa(2)eulphi"></a>

#### Summary

For relatively prime integers $a$ and $m \geq 1$:
$$
m | (a^{\phi(m)} - 1)
$$

#### Proof

The proof is on page 45 of the TB.

#### Fermats Little Theorem

The special case of *Euler's Theorem*, men $m$ is prime, in known as *Fermat's Little Theorem*.

##### Summary

For some prime $p$ and integer $a$:
$$
p \mid (a^p -a)
$$

##### Proof

It must be such that $p​$ divides $a​$ or $p​$ does not divide $a​$ , hence:

| $p \mid a$                                                   | $ p \nmid a$                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| if $p \mid a$ <br />$\implies p \mid a^n, \enspace \exists n \in \mathbb{N}$<br /> $\implies p \mid a^{p-1}$ <br /> $\implies p \mid (a^p -a)$ | if $p\nmid a$<br /><br />Then $p$ and $a$ are relatively prime, thus, *Eulers Theorem* applies;<br /><br />By *Euler's Theorem*:<br />$p|(a^{\phi(p)}-1)$<br />$\implies p \mid (a^{(p^1-p^0)}-1)$<br />$\implies p \mid (a^{(p-1)}-1)$<br />$\implies p \mid (a \cdot (a^{(p-1)}-1))$<br />$\implies p \mid (a^p-a)$ |

Thus for a prime $p$ and integer $a$:
$$
p \mid (a^p - a)
$$

# (3) Relations and Congruence
<a name="aatop3"></a>

[Back to Top](#antoc)

* [Relations](#aa(3)rel)
* [Congruence Modulo n](#aa(3)con)
* [The Ring](#aa(3)ringintro)

## Relations

<a name="aa(3)rel"></a>

A relation on a set $A$ is a subset $R$ of the cartesian product:
$$
A\times A = \{(a,b) : a,b \in A\}
$$
if $(a,b) \in R$ we write that $\enspace a \enspace R \enspace b$

### Example

If we had the relation $<$ on the set $A$ = \{1,2,3\}.

​	The Cartesian product would be:
$$
A \times A = \{(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3,3)\}
$$
The set corresponding to the relation $<$ would be:
$$
\{(1,2), (1, 3), (2, 3)\}
$$

### Relation Types

* **Reflexive** relations are relations where
  * $a \enspace R \enspace a$
    * $\forall a \enspace \in A$
* **Symmetric** relations are such that
  * $a \enspace R \enspace b \implies b \enspace R \enspace a$
    * $\forall a, b \in A$
* **Transitive** relations are such that
  * $a \enspace R \enspace b \quad \wedge \quad  b \enspace R \enspace c \implies  b \enspace R \enspace a$
    * $\forall a,b,c\in A$

An equivalence relation is a relation that is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.

#### Example 1

Let $S = \{\text{all people}\}$

We will define a relation $R$ as satisfied if thouse people share the same parents

##### Define a relation

$x \enspace R \enspace y$ if $x$ has the same parents as $y$

observe the following properties:

* **Reflexivity**; any person will be related to themselves because they share the same parents

* **symmetry**; If percy is related to Fred, then they share parents and hence then Fred must be related to Percy.

* **Transivity**; If Percy is related to Fred and Fred is Related to Ron, Ron and Percy must share parents, thus Ron and Percy are Related.

#### Example 2

Let $S$ be all real numbers

##### Define a Relation:

$x<y \iff x \enspace R \enspace y$

observe the following properties:

* **Non-Reflexive**; any number is not less than its own value.
* **Non-Symmetry**
  * Take 5 and 7, if $5<7$ , then $7 \nless 5$
* **Transitive**; It is true that if, say, $3<4$ and $4<5$ then $3<5$
  * This property is why we ordinarily write interval notation in this format, e.g. $x\in (3,5) \iff 3<x<5​$ 
    * Be careful though, using greater than symbols is not transitive per se and may lead to making transcription errors.

### Equivalence Class 

Given a relation $R$ on some set $A$,

If $[a]$ is the set of all elements of $A$ that satisfy the relation for $a$:
$$
[a]_R = [a] = \{b \in A : b\enspace R \enspace a\}
$$
This is called the *equivalence class of*  $a$ *with respect to* $R$

#### Example

Let $S$ all real numbers.

**Define a relation:**

$x \enspace R \enspace y \iff x < y$

Let’s find the equivalence class of $[6]$:

$[6]_R = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$

#### Proposition

Let $R$ be an equivalence relation on $A$:

​	if $a,b \in A$, then either,

* $[a] = [b]$, OR
* $[a]\cap [b] = \emptyset$

So if $a$ and $b$ are both elements of $A$, then their equivalence classes are identical or absolutely different.

   

## Congruence Modulo *n*

<a name="aa(3)con"></a>

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$

We say that:

$a$ and $b$ are *congruent modulo n$ if $n \mid (a-b)$, and it is expressed:

$$
a\equiv b \enspace \pmod{n}
$$

or in other words:

$$
a\equiv b \enspace (mod n) \iff a = b + q\cdot n : q \in \mathbb{R}
$$


### Further Notation;
Generally the notation:

$$
a \mod n = r
$$

Refers to the remainder after $a$ has been divided by $n$ (i.e. the residue of $a$ modulo $n$)

So be careful:

| **This is a number** | **This is a statement about Divisibility** |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| $a \mod n = r$       | $a\equiv b \enspace \pmod{n}$              |

### The Euclidean Algorithm

if $a = q\cdot b +r$ then $a\equiv b \enspace \pmod{n}$ 

Recall from the *Euclidean Algorithm*:

$$
a = q\cdot b +r \implies \gcd(a,b) = \gcd(b,r)
$$

This translates to:

$a \equiv r \pmod{b} \implies \gcd(a,b) = \gcd(b,r)$

#### Eulers Theorem

*Euler's Theorem* (and hence *Fermat's Little Theorem) can now be restated in terms of modulos.

For relatively prime integers $a$ and $m \geq 1$:

$$
\begin{align}
m \mid (&a^{\phi (m)}-1) \\
&a^{\phi (m)} \equiv 1 \pmod{m}
\end{align}
$$

##### Fermats Little Theorem
The special case of $Euler's Theorem$, when $m$ is prime, is known as *Fermat's Little Theorem*.

$$
p \mid (a^p-a) \\
a^p \equiv a \pmod{p}
$$

### Residue of $a$ modulo $n$ (i.e. remainder of Division Algorithm)
If $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$

Then $a = b \pmod{n}$ if and only if $a$ and $b$ have the same remainder when divided by $n$.

If the remainder is $r$ then:

$$
a \equiv r \pmod{n}
$$

> i.e. $a = p\cdot n +r, \enspace \exists p \in \mathbb{R}$

This valur $r$ is known as the *residue of a modulo n$ and can always be found to exist.

### Mod Laws
Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ and $ a,b,c,d, k \in \mathbb{Z}
nd $m \in \mathbb{N}$

1. $a \equiv b \pmod{n} \implies k\cdot a \equiv k\cdot b \pmod{n}​$
2. $\Big( a \equiv b \pmod{n} \enspace \wedge \enspace c = d \pmod{n} \Big)$
   1. $\implies (a+c) \equiv (b+d) \pmod{n}$, and also
   2. $\implies (a\cdot c) \equiv (b\cdot d) \pmod{n}$

### Congruence Class

Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ and $a \in \mathbb{Z}$

The congruence class of $a$ modulo $n$ is epxressed as $[a]_n$

It is the equivalence class of $a$ whereby the relation is a congruence in modulo $n$.

So in mathematical terms, the congruence class of $a$ is $[a]_n$:

$$
[a]_n = \{ b \in \mathbb{Z} : b \equiv a \pmod{n} \}
$$

> e.g. $[10]_3 = \{1,4,7,10,13,16 \dots 3n + r : n \in \mathbb{Z} \}$
>
> > Observe here that $r=1$


## The Ring [2.4]

<a name="aa(3)ringintro"></a>

The ring $\mathbb{Z}_m$ is the set of all congruence classes less than $m$ such that:

$$
\mathbb{Z}_m = \{ [0]_m, [1]_m, [2]_m, [3]_m, \dots [m-1]_m\}, \enspace  \forall m \in \mathbb{Z}^+
$$

### Example
We could list all the congruence classes of $\mathbb{Z}_5$:

$$
\mathbb{Z}_5 = \{[0]_5, [1]_5, [2]_5, [3]_5, [4]_5\}
$$

Where:

* $[0]_5 = \{\dots -5, 0, 5, 10, 15 \dots \}$
* $[1]_5 = \{\dots -4, 1, 6, 11, 16 \dots \}$
* $[2]_5 = \{ \dots -3, 2, 7, 12, 17, \dots \}$
* $[3]_5 = \{ \dots -2, 3, 8, 13, 18 \dots \}$
* $[4]_5 = \{\dots -1, 4, 9, 14, 19 \dots \}$

Hence $\mathbb{Z}_5$ could be expressed equivalently as:

$$
 \mathbb{Z}_5 = \{[5]_5, [11]_5, [17]_5, [19]_5, [9]_5\}
$$

### Operations on Congruence Classes
The elements of  $\mathbb{Z}_5$ can be manipulated algebraically, they have an algebraic structure, observe the following operations $\forall a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z}$.

#### Addition 
Addition is commutative and associative:

$$
\begin{align}
[a]_m + [b]_m &= [a+b]_m \\
&= [b]_m + [a]_m
\end{align}
$$

#### Multiplication 
Multiplication is commutative and associative

$$
\begin{align}
[a]_m \cdot [b]_m &= [a\cdot b]_m\\
&= [b]_m \cdot  [a]_m
\end{align}
$$

#### Linear Combination
Addition and Multiplication can be combined:
$$
[a]_m \cdot \big( [b]_m + [c]_m \big) = [a]_m \cdot [b]_m + [a]_m \cdot [c]_m
$$

## Linear Congruence Equations [2.1]

<a name="aa(4)lincon"></a>

A linear congruence equation is of the form:


$$
a\cdot x \equiv b \pmod{n}
$$

where $a,b \in \mathbb{z}$ and $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ are fixed numbers and $x \in \mathbb{Z}$ is a variable.

So an example could be:

$$
3x \equiv 7 \pmod{8}
$$

The solution to this equation is the set of all x values values for which the expression is true, i.e. the solution is the set $X$ such that:

$$
X = \{x: 3x \equiv 7 \pmod{8} \}
$$

### Coingruence Class
if some $z \in \mathbb{Z}$ is a solution of a linear congruence equation, then all members of the congruence class $[z]_n$ are also solutions as well.

The complete set of solutions is the congruence class $[z]_{\frac{n}{d}}.

### Testing whether a solution exists
A linear congruence equation only has a solution, if and only if:

$$
gcd(a,n) \mid b
$$

#### Example

* $2x \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ has **no** solution because $\gcd(2,4) = 2 \nmid 1$

* Small MathBlocks on iPhone

  * If numbered equations are used, they will render extremely small on an iPhone, is the trade off worth it?

    * It's relatively easy to enable and disable numbered mathblocks in *Typora* on the fly through the preferences <kbd> Ctrl </kbd> + <kbd> , </kbd>  <sub> on mac <kbd> ⌘ </kbd> + <kbd> , </kbd> </sub>
